# Qollab

## Setting up environment for the first time
* For Mac users:
  1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't already. 
  2. `brew install docker`
  3. `brew install docker-compose`
* For windows users:
  1. Go to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/ to install Docker.
  2. Go to https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose to install Docker Compose.

Then `git clone https://github.com/shannonphu/qollab.git`

## Development Workflow
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Make sure your Docker Daemon is running. For Mac, you'll see the whale icon on the top right corner which is the daemon, so make sure that is running.
3. Run `docker-compose up --build` when you've made changes to the code. Or omit the `--build` flag if you have made no changes.
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/

## Pull Request Workflow
* Make a new branch formatted `<your-name>/<feature-name>` to submit a pull request to master.
* Notify team that a PR has been made :)
